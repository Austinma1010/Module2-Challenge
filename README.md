# Module2-Challenge

## Description
Created a portfolio that will display my name, information about me, and will provide links to past projects I've worked on

## Goals
WHEN I load my portfolio
#### THEN I'm presented with my name, a photo of myself, and links to sections about myself, my work, and my contact info
WHEN I click one of the navigation links
#### THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I view the first example of my work
#### THEN it appears larger than the other examples
WHEN I click on the image of the first example
#### THEN I'm taken to the deployed application
WHEN I resize the page
#### THEN the layout of the website adapts to my viewport
